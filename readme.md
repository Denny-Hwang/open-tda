# TDA

Can we replicate [Anadasi](https://www.ayasdi.com/) with [kepler-mapper](https://github.com/scikit-tda/kepler-mapper), [graph-tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/), and [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets)? Let's try!

## To Run

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Todo/Ideas

- Can we run it on [binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)?
- [Pie chart nodes](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/static/doc/demos/inference/inference.html?highlight=pie#id15)?
